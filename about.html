              accountant) when she had her son. Though she didn't finish the
              program due to motherhood, her level of education is much higher
              than the average bookkeeper, allowing her to understand and
              facilitate higher level accounting theory practices. She graduated
              from McMaster University with an advanced accounting diploma and
              from Mohawk College with a diploma in Accounting, both of which

              office assistance diploma. After completing this level, she
              realized that she belonged more in the finance side of things so
